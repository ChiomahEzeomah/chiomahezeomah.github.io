I am an immunologist and a biostatistician/ data scientist / analyst who is passionate about infectious diseases research. I am particularly interested in viruses like SARS-CoV-2, Lassa, Ebola and their mechanisms of cellular damage in organ systems in the body like the brain. I hold a masters degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from [Cornell University](https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu/biostatistics-and-data-science), and a second masters degree in Integrated Immunology from the [University of Oxford](https://www.nds.ox.ac.uk). 

For my undergraduate studies, I studied biological sciences, mathematics and economics at the [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu). I then worked at the [Galveston National Laboratory](https://www.utmb.edu/gnl) at the [University of Texas Medical Branch](https://www.utmb.edu) for over two years where I conducted research on the following viruses: Lassa virus, Junin virus, Zika virus, Influenza virus, as well as HIV.
